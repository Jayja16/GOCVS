      Why is this service only available for certificates issued within the last 3 years?
    </div>
    <div class="accordion-item-body">
      <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
        Being a recent initiative and considering the amount of resources needed to put this project up, the GCE board
        decided to make it available for certificates involved within the last 3 years for management purposes
        and to analyse how it is received by the public. If the feedback is positive, we will see how to make
        it available to older candidates too

      Verification of my certificate failed though I wrote the GCE exam. What do I do?
    </div>
    <div class="accordion-item-body">
      <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
        First, check if you have correctly entered your CIN as it is on your certificate. Secondly, if your certificate
        has not yet been issued then there will be no means of verifying it. If you keep experiencing the
        same problem, try refreshing the page and if the problem persists don't hesitate to contact us.
